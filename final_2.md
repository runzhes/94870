## User research and interviews
###  Target audience
My target audiences could be environmental advocates who want to understand how wind energy has contributed to reducing carbon emissions; investors who need to see the economic trajectory of the wind energy sector to make informed decisions; educators who require accessible data visualizations to teach students about renewable energy growth.

### Identify representative individuals to interview
When targeting environmental advocates, investors, and educators, but with limited access to professionals in these fields, interviewing students with similar backgrounds or interests can be a viable alternative. Here is my detailed approach:
- For each target audience, define the key characteristics or interests that a student should have to be a representative interviewee.
  - Environmental Advocates: Students engaged in environmental clubs, active in sustainability initiatives, or studying environmental science.
  - Investors: Business or finance students with an interest in sustainable investments or renewable energy markets.
  - Educators: Students in education programs who show a keen interest in innovative teaching methods or environmental education.
- Use university networks.
  - Reach out to university departments and clubs relevant to target groups. For instance, contact the environmental science department for environmental advocates, the business school for investor    
    representatives, and the education department for future educators.
  - Utilize student organizations focused on sustainability, investing, or educational development.
- Ensure diversity and inclusivity.
  - Strive to get a diverse range of perspectives by including students from different backgrounds, academic years, and with varied experiences related to sustainability, investment, and education.

### Interview script
- As you went through the story, was there a particular chart or piece of information that really stood out or grabbed your attention?
- Were there any elements in the story that surprised you or anything you found a bit unclear or confusing?
- Did you notice a progression in the story, like a build-up, a peak moment, and then a resolution? How did that flow feel to you?
- Who do you think this story is primarily aimed at?
- After going through this story, do you feel motivated to take any action or learn more about wind energy and its impacts?
- Is there any aspect of the story that you think could be improved or presented differently? Any suggestions youâ€™d like to share?"

### Findings from interviews
Participant 1 (Engineering Student, 25, Active in Sustainability Initiatives)
- The participant was impressed by the clarity and interactivity of the world map depicting wind energy capacity, finding it particularly effective.
- Suggested enhancements for the life-cycle emission chart and the consumption share chart, recommending the use of arrows, labels, or striking colors to highlight wind technologies more prominently.
- The smaller-than-expected share of wind energy was surprising, as the participant initially thought it would be larger.
- Expressed a desire to understand more about the disparities in wind energy capacity between developed and developing countries.
- The story arc was perceived as clear and well-structured, with a noticeable build-up, peak, and resolution, following modern web design trends.
- The call to action part, particularly the slogan, was well-received, indicating effective communication in this section.
- While the focus on educators as a target audience was somewhat unexpected for the participant, they found the other two audience categories (environmental advocates and investors) clear and reasonable.
- The suggestion to include energy development companies as a target audience was made, with the aim of persuading them to transition to wind energy.
- The story piqued the participant's interest in learning more about wind energy, indicating its success in engaging and educating about the sector's potential and current market share.

Participant 2 (Economics Student, 23, Interested in Sustainable Investments)
- The participant found certain aspects of the story unclear, particularly the difference between 'operating' capacity and increments in capacity.
- Suggested clarifying the storyline, especially the transition between sections on share and capacity increment, it was recommended to potentially exclude the geographic part to improve clarity.
- The use of technical terms like 'coal-PC' and 'solar-PV' was confusing for a non-professional audience. Simplifying or explaining these terms could enhance understanding.
- It was noted that the designation of the 'Top 5 wind energy share countries' was not immediately clear in the sixth chart, leading to potential confusion.
- The first chart, focusing on annual increment, was not immediately recognized as such. The participant suggested adding a vertical auxiliary line for better understanding.
- In the life-cycle emission chart, switching the x and y-axes was recommended for improved readability.
- The first world map showing wind capacity differences among countries didn't highlight significant disparities as effectively as it could have.
- Africa was unreadable in the first chart; changing the order of regions or adjusting colors was advised for better visibility.
- The story was found to be interesting and sparked an interest in learning more about the field, indicating a successful engagement with the topic.
- While the current audience categorization (environmental advocates, investors, educators) was deemed reasonable, the participant suggested expanding it to include policymakers, government officers, and energy development companies, which could benefit from this information.

Participant 3 (Engineering Student, 23, Interested in Innovative Teaching Methods)
- The participant found the global map on wind energy capacity clear and easy to understand.
- They suggested direct labeling on each line in the line chart for better readability and ease of matching data points, instead of relying on a legend.
- The small 3% share of wind energy in the energy mix came as a surprise.
- While the participant could follow the general structure of the story, they noted that the logic could be clearer.
- Recommended adding a summary, needs, highlights, or conclusions in subheadings, particularly for the chapter on geographic spread, to enhance clarity and provide context for each section.
- The participant felt the target audience categories were too broad, specifically pointing out that 'environmental advocates' and 'educators' could be more narrowly defined.
- Suggestions for expanding the target audience included policymakers and landowners, reflecting a broader range of stakeholders.
- There was a clear interest in learning more about wind energy data, indicating engagement with the topic and a desire for deeper knowledge.
- The overall story arc was somewhat recognizable, but the participant indicated a need for more defined narrative structure.
- To make each chapter more impactful, they proposed adding specific conclusions or key takeaways, which could be especially beneficial for chapters like 'geographic spread'.

###  Changes plan on implementing
Based on the feedback from the three participants, there are several changes and improvements I plan to implement in my visualizations for the next phase of the project. The feedback provides valuable insights into areas of clarity, engagement, and audience targeting. Here's how I plan to use this feedback:
- Consistent Feedback and Planned Changes:
  - Enhance Data Visualization Clarity:
    - World Map Enhancements: Maintain the clarity and interactivity of the world map as it was well-received.
    - Chart Modifications: Add direct labels to the line charts for better readability, as suggested by both Participant 3 and Participant 2. This will eliminate the need for cross-referencing with a legend.
    - Highlight Key Data: Use arrows, labels, or distinctive colors in the life-cycle emission chart and consumption share chart to highlight wind technologies more effectively, as advised by Participant 1 and Participant 2.
  - Improve Storyline and Logic:
    - Clarify Terminology: Simplify technical terms (like 'coal-PC', 'solar-PV') for a broader audience's understanding.
    - Story Structure: Enhance the logic and flow of the story, making the transition between sections smoother, especially between 'share' and 'capacity increment' sections.
    - Subheadings and Summaries: Add summaries or key takeaways at the beginning or end of each chapter, especially in 'geographic spread', to provide context and highlight the main points.
  - Address Audience Targeting:
    - Audience Expansion: Include policymakers, landowners, and energy development companies as part of the target audience to broaden the impact.
    - Narrow Down Categories: Refine the categories for 'environmental advocates' and 'educators' to make them more specific and relatable.
- Addressing Conflicting Observations:
  - Geographical Content: While Participant 2 suggested possibly excluding the geographic part for clarity, the global map was highly praised by the other participants for its clarity and effectiveness. In response, I will retain the geographic elements but ensure they are integrated more seamlessly into the narrative.
