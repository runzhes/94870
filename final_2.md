## User research and interviews
###  Target audience
My target audiences could be environmental advocates who want to understand how wind energy has contributed to reducing carbon emissions; investors who need to see the economic trajectory of the wind energy sector to make informed decisions; educators who require accessible data visualizations to teach students about renewable energy growth.

### Identify representative individuals to interview
When targeting environmental advocates, investors, and educators, but with limited access to professionals in these fields, interviewing students with similar backgrounds or interests can be a viable alternative. Here is my detailed approach:
- For each target audience, define the key characteristics or interests that a student should have to be a representative interviewee.
  - Environmental Advocates: Students engaged in environmental clubs, active in sustainability initiatives, or studying environmental science.
  - Investors: Business or finance students with an interest in sustainable investments or renewable energy markets.
  - Educators: Students in education programs who show a keen interest in innovative teaching methods or environmental education.
- Use university networks.
  - Reach out to university departments and clubs relevant to target groups. For instance, contact the environmental science department for environmental advocates, the business school for investor    
    representatives, and the education department for future educators.
  - Utilize student organizations focused on sustainability, investing, or educational development.
- Ensure diversity and inclusivity.
  - Strive to get a diverse range of perspectives by including students from different backgrounds, academic years, and with varied experiences related to sustainability, investment, and education.
