## User research and interviews
###  Target audience
My target audiences could be environmental advocates who want to understand how wind energy has contributed to reducing carbon emissions; investors who need to see the economic trajectory of the wind energy sector to make informed decisions; educators who require accessible data visualizations to teach students about renewable energy growth.

### Identify representative individuals to interview
When targeting environmental advocates, investors, and educators, but with limited access to professionals in these fields, interviewing students with similar backgrounds or interests can be a viable alternative. Here is my detailed approach:
- For each target audience, define the key characteristics or interests that a student should have to be a representative interviewee.
  - Environmental Advocates: Students engaged in environmental clubs, active in sustainability initiatives, or studying environmental science.
  - Investors: Business or finance students with an interest in sustainable investments or renewable energy markets.
  - Educators: Students in education programs who show a keen interest in innovative teaching methods or environmental education.
- Use university networks.
  - Reach out to university departments and clubs relevant to target groups. For instance, contact the environmental science department for environmental advocates, the business school for investor    
    representatives, and the education department for future educators.
  - Utilize student organizations focused on sustainability, investing, or educational development.
- Ensure diversity and inclusivity.
  - Strive to get a diverse range of perspectives by including students from different backgrounds, academic years, and with varied experiences related to sustainability, investment, and education.

### Interview script
- As you went through the story, was there a particular chart or piece of information that really stood out or grabbed your attention?
- Were there any elements in the story that surprised you or anything you found a bit unclear or confusing?
- Did you notice a progression in the story, like a build-up, a peak moment, and then a resolution? How did that flow feel to you?
- Who do you think this story is primarily aimed at?
- After going through this story, do you feel motivated to take any action or learn more about wind energy and its impacts?
- Is there any aspect of the story that you think could be improved or presented differently? Any suggestions youâ€™d like to share?"

### Findings from interviews
Participant 1 (Engineering Student, 25, active in sustainability initiatives)
- .
Participant 2 (Economics Student, 23, Interested in Sustainable Investments)
- The participant found certain aspects of the story unclear, particularly the difference between 'operating' capacity and increments in capacity.
- Suggested clarifying the storyline, especially the transition between sections on share and capacity increment, it was recommended to potentially exclude the geographic part to improve clarity.
- The use of technical terms like 'coal-PC' and 'solar-PV' was confusing for a non-professional audience. Simplifying or explaining these terms could enhance understanding.
- It was noted that the designation of the 'Top 5 wind energy share countries' was not immediately clear in the sixth chart, leading to potential confusion.
- The first chart, focusing on annual increment, was not immediately recognized as such. The participant suggested adding a vertical auxiliary line for better understanding.
- In the life-cycle emission chart, switching the x and y-axes was recommended for improved readability.
- The first world map showing wind capacity differences among countries didn't highlight significant disparities as effectively as it could have.
- Africa was unreadable in the first chart; changing the order of regions or adjusting colors was advised for better visibility.
- The story was found to be interesting and sparked an interest in learning more about the field, indicating a successful engagement with the topic.
- While the current audience categorization (environmental advocates, investors, educators) was deemed reasonable, the participant suggested expanding it to include policymakers, government officers, and energy development companies, which could benefit from this information.
Participant 3 (Engineering Student, 23, interest in innovative teaching methods)
