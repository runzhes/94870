# Harnessing the Wind: A Decade of Growth in Global Wind Energy
## Outline
### High-Level Summary
Wind energy stands at the forefront of the global shift towards renewable power sources. This project, "Harnessing the Wind," aims to unravel the story of wind energy's meteoric rise over the past decade. Through a series of compelling data visualizations, we will explore the expansion of wind power installations worldwide, examine the increasing contribution of wind energy to the global energy mix, and understand the environmental and economic impacts of this green revolution. This story is not just about numbers and statistics; it's about the collective strides humanity is making towards a more sustainable future.
