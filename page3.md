## Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday
I selected a specific visualization that portrays the market share of global electric vehicle sales on a quarterly basis from Q3 2021 to Q2 2023. My rationale for choosing this visualization is threefold. Firstly, it complies fully with the rubric requirements, as the underlying data is readily extractable and can be replicated with precision. Secondly, the dataset is both clear and succinct, obviating the need for any preliminary data cleaning or preprocessing — a factor that significantly streamlines the visualization process. Lastly, the subject of the dataset resonates with my personal interests in sustainability and decarbonization, with electric vehicles being a topic I am particularly passionate about.

## Step two: critique the data visualization
What Doesn't Work As Well:
- The color palette could be improved. The red and pink hues used for Tesla and BYD Auto, respectively, are too similar and can cause confusion. This is particularly important as these companies' shares are often adjacent within the bars.
- The "Others" category, represented in grey, becomes less dominant over time but does not draw much attention due to its neutral color. This is a critical trend that might be overlooked due to its subdued presentation.

Potential Improvements:
- Introduce a wider range of colors with higher contrast to differentiate between companies more distinctly.
- Incorporate interactive elements that allow viewers to hover over segments to see more details, such as the actual number of units sold or year-over-year growth rates.
- Add trend lines or annotations to highlight significant changes, such as a major increase or decrease in a company's market share, to guide the viewer to these points of interest.
- I would consider a different visualization type, like a line chart, to depict the change over time more dynamically. Each company could have its line with points for each quarter, making it easier to follow individual trajectories.

## Step three: sketch out a solution
Informed by the insights from the critique methodology, I have endeavored to reimagine the visualization, the draft of which is presented below. I explored an alternative approach, opting for an area chart to represent the data. This choice was strategic; an area chart not only illustrates the evolution of market shares over time with greater dynamism but also clearly delineates each company's share per quarter. While I have not addressed the issue of the color palette in this preliminary draft, I plan to refine it in Tableau during Step five. The primary aim of this draft, and the subsequent interview, is to gauge the efficacy of the area chart in conveying the information. Specifically, I intend to determine if the area chart facilitates a more intuitive understanding for the audience compared to the bar chart or other chart types, such as the line chart.
